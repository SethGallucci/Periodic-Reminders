# Periodic-Reminders


## Reminder Types

#### Timer
A timer reminder regularly triggers after the number of seconds specified by the user.

#### Turn
A turn reminder will trigger up to a number of turn before or after, or even on the turn of the user's character, as per the number of turns specified by the user. It can also be made to trigger at the start of combat.

#### Round
A round reminder triggers on the beginning of a new round in combat.

#### Login
A login reminder triggers upon the user logging in.


## Application Links
When a reminder triggers, its linked applications will be rendered at their saved locations, with their saved sizes.

#### Adding Application Links
To add an application to the reminder, simply drag the ui element that opens the application onto the *Application Links* header or list of application links. Various elements such as items, character sheets, journal entries, card piles, roll tables, and macros can be added to a reminder as a valid application link. *Note:* Periodic Reminders does not currently support application links created via compendia. However, after something is imported from a compendium, the new, imported thing can be used to create an application link.

#### Removing Application Links
To remove an application link, click the unlink button on the right side of the application link.

#### Arranging Application Links
To set the pop-up locations and sizes of the linked applications for when the reminder triggers, click the *Arrange* button on the right side of an *Application Links* header. Then, move and resize the applications to the desired locations and sizes. Finally, click the save button on the *Arrange Applications* pop-up.
